This app calculates arbitrage profit/loss percentage between two markets/exchanges in a four way fashion(quad). The asset pairs between the exchanges are seperated by a grey dash line indicating the left side as one exchange/market and the right side as another exchange/market. You add and fill in asset pairs and it calculates the profit/loss percentage for you. You can also adjust the trade fees and the intermediary asset for each exchange. Also by default, the results are sorted to show only positive outcomes from highest to lowest. To see all possibilities, click the serial number next to the green square to show all outcomes.

## Limitations

You have to fill in the values manually by hand and it can only with in a four way formation(quad). Its not a serious project, just wanted to put it up here on github.
