# Arbitage-Helper

This app calculates arbitrage profit/loss percentage between two markets/exchanges in a four way fashion(quad). The asset pairs between the exchanges are seperated by a grey dash line indicating the left side as one exchange/market and the right side as another exchange/market. You add and fill in asset pairs and it calculates the profit/loss percentage for you. You can also adjust the trade fees and the intermediary asset for each exchange.

## Limitations

You have to fill in the values manually by hand and it can only with in a four way formation(quad). Its not a serious project, just wanted to put it up here on github.
